# ðŸ“Ž Attachment Functions

This section covers PowerShell cmdlets for managing attachments in TriliumNext. Attachments allow you to associate files with your notes, whether as embedded images, downloadable files, or binary content.

!!! warning
    All functions require authentication via [`Connect-TriliumAuth`](../auth/Connect-TriliumAuth.md) before use.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Upload an Image Attachment

```powershell
# Upload an image and append it to a note
New-TriliumAttachment -OwnerId "abc123" -FilePath "C:\images\screenshot.png"
```

### Create a File Note

```powershell
# Create a new note containing a PDF file
New-TriliumNoteFile -ParentNoteId "abc123" -FilePath "C:\documents\manual.pdf"
```

### Download Attachment Content

```powershell
# Get attachment content and save to disk
$content = Get-TriliumAttachmentContent -AttachmentID "evnnmvHTCgIn"
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("C:\downloads\file.pdf", $content)
```

### List Note Attachments

```powershell
# Get all attachments for a specific note
Get-TriliumNoteAttachment -NoteID "jfkls7klusi"
```

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts

### Attachment Types
- **Image attachments**: Automatically embedded as images in notes
- **File attachments**: Added as downloadable links
- **Binary content**: Raw file data stored in notes

### MIME Type Detection
Most cmdlets automatically detect MIME types from file extensions, but you can override this behavior:

```powershell
New-TriliumAttachment -OwnerId "abc123" -FilePath "file.dat" -Mime "application/octet-stream"
```

### Pipeline Support
Several cmdlets support pipeline input for batch operations:

```powershell
"att1", "att2", "att3" | Remove-TriliumAttachment
```
